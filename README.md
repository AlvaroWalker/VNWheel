This is open source force feedback wheel base on Adruino 1.8.10

The code use some library, file from other projects like:
- adapt-ffb-joy 
- ForceFeedback-core-library
- kaskus forums
- microchip forums

It is not commercial project. If I have liciense issues, let me know if not allow. I will remove the unliciense file/functions.
